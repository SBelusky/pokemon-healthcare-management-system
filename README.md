## How to build the backend services

Run the following command to build and package the backend services into a docker container

```shell
mvn spring-boot:build-image -DdockerPassword=<your-docker-account-password>

## How to run the backend services

Make sure you have the following installed on your machine:

- Java 21
- Docker
- Kind Cluster - https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/docs/user/quick-start/#installation

### Start Kind Cluster
    
Run the k8s/kind/create-kind-cluster.sh script to create the kind Kubernetes cluster

```shell
./k8s/kind/create-kind-cluster.sh
```
This will create a kind cluster and pre-load all the required docker images into the cluster, this will save you time downloading the images when you deploy the application.

### Deploy the infrastructure

Run the k8s/manisfests/infrastructure.yaml file to deploy the infrastructure

```shell
kubectl apply -f k8s/manifests/infrastructure.yaml
```

### Deploy the services

Run the k8s/manifests/applications.yaml file to deploy the services

```shell
kubectl apply -f k8s/manifests/applications.yaml
```

### Access the API Gateway

To access the API Gateway, you need to port-forward the gateway service to your local machine

```shell
kubectl port-forward svc/api-gateway 9000:9000
```

### Access the Keycloak Admin Console
To access the Keycloak admin console, you need to port-forward the keycloak service to your local machine

```shell
kubectl port-forward svc/keycloak 8080:8080
```

### Access the Grafana Dashboards
